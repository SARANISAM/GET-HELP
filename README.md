## Project Description
GetHelp is a locality-based service web application that connects users with nearby workers such as electricians, plumbers, carpenters, and technicians. Users can quickly search services, filter by locality, view worker locations on a map, and instantly know real-time availability through an online/offline toggle.

---

## Problem Statement
In many semi-urban and neighborhood communities, people struggle to find reliable nearby service workers quickly. Existing platforms are overcrowded, city-focused, and often lack real-time availability, making urgent help difficult to access.

---

## Solution
GetHelp provides a simple and fast platform where users can search services based on locality, locate workers on a map, and contact verified helpers. Workers can manage their profile and control their visibility using a real-time online/offline toggle, ensuring transparency and trust.
