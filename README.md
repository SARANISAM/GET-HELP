Project Description

GETHELP is a locality-based service web application that connects users with nearby workers such as plumbers, electricians, and carpenters. Users can quickly search, view, and contact verified local helpers within their neighborhood.
A unique highlight of the platform is the real-time Online/Offline availability toggle for workers along with an interactive map view, enabling customers to instantly see who is available and where they are located. The system focuses on simplicity, speed, and locality filtering, making it especially useful for remote and community-level users.

Problem Statement

In many local and semi-urban communities, people struggle to quickly find reliable nearby service workers. Existing platforms are often overcrowded, city-centric, or lack real-time availability, which makes accessing trustworthy help during urgent situations difficult and time-consuming.

Proposed Solution

We are building a locality-based service web application that directly connects users with verified workers in their neighborhood.
Key solution elements include:

Locality Filters for accurate nearby results

Real-Time Online/Offline Toggle for worker availability

Integrated Map View to visually locate workers instantly

This ensures fast, simple, and dependable access to essential services, particularly for remote and community-level users.

Overall Demo Description – GetHelp Web Application

GetHelp is a locality-based service web application designed to connect users with nearby skilled workers such as electricians, plumbers, carpenters, and technicians. The platform focuses on speed, simplicity, and real-time availability, making it easy for people in neighborhoods and semi-urban areas to quickly find trusted help.

The demo begins with the main landing page, where the user is presented with two clear options: User Login or Worker Login. From here, the application branches into two different experiences depending on the role selected.

Vocal Login Page (Common Entry)

The Vocal Login page is a simple and clean authentication screen that contains:

Email field

Password field

Login button

Signup options for User and Worker

It performs basic email and password verification, ensuring secure and quick access. This page acts as the gateway to both dashboards.

User Dashboard Description

Once a user logs in, they are redirected to the User Home Dashboard.

Key elements shown in the demo:

Search Bar – Users can type a service such as “Plumber” or “Electrician.”

Locality Filter – Helps narrow results to nearby workers.

Service Category Selection – Quick buttons for common services.

Map View – Displays worker locations visually so the user can pick the closest one.

Worker Details Panel – Shows name, profession, contact, and availability status.

The user dashboard emphasizes ease of discovery — find, view, and contact workers within seconds.

Worker Dashboard Description

After a worker logs in, they are taken to the Worker Dashboard, which is more profile-centric and control-based.

Key highlights in the demo:

Profile Section – Shows worker name, profession, contact info, and locality.

Online / Offline Toggle Button – A unique real-time availability switch that lets workers instantly appear or disappear from user search results.

Job Visibility / Status Area – Helps workers monitor requests or visibility.

Last Seen / Activity Indicator – Shows whether the worker is recently active.

The worker dashboard focuses on control and visibility, allowing workers to manage their availability globally with a single click.

Flow & Architecture Explanation in Demo

The demo video then briefly explains the workflow architecture:

GetHelp Landing Page

Choose User Login or Worker Login

Signup if new → Return to Login

User Path: Login → User Home → Search Services → View Map → Contact Worker

Worker Path: Login → Worker Dashboard → Toggle Online/Offline → Manage Profile

This structured flow demonstrates how both user and worker journeys are simple, direct, and role-specific, ensuring smooth interaction and fast service matching.
